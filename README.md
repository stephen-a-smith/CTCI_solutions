# CTCI solutions
Solutions to problems from the book Cracking the Coding Interview

Solutions will be given in C, Rust, Python, Java, and Bash

A note on Bash: 
  Not all problems will be solved in Bash, because bash as a language isn't very well suited to complex data structures (Graphs, Linked Lists).
