# CTCI solutions
Solutions to problems from the book Cracking the Coding Interview

Solutions will be given in a variety of language

Not all problems will be solved in every language, because some languages aren't very well suited to certain tasks.

All Code written is my own - The Problems are exercises taking from "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
