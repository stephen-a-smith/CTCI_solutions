# CTCI solutions
Solutions to problems from the book Cracking the Coding Interview

Solutions will be given in a variety of languages, both scriping languages and more traditionall programming languages

A note on Bash: 
  * Not all problems will be solved in Bash, because bash as a language isn't very well suited to complex data structures (Graphs, Linked Lists).

All Code written is my own - The Problems are exercises taking from "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.
